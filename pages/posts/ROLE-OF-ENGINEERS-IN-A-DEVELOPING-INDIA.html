                        <p> India is developing day to day and all the Indians are working for this development. Every
                            Indian is a part of this evolution with his/her professions of Teacher, Doctor, Scientist,
                            Army, Politician, Engineers or whatever they are.</p>
                        <p><img src="{% static '/images/role_of_engineers_in_developing_india.webp' %}"></p>
                        <p>Engineers are the substructure of the evolving India. They designs, builds and maintains this
                            development. Every building, machines, gadget are designed by an Engineer. It is not just a
                            degree in India, It is a faith. Faith of Indians to Engineers, that they do anything for
                            developing India. They Building smart cities in India, Digitalise the India, Introduce
                            bullet trains in India, Gift rail route to The Vashno Devi with their thoughts or much more.
                            They are not just engineers but also a part of society and beyond their profession they are
                            good people with their knowledge and thinking. During their education they learn about how
                            to treat others in family, in society and also learn how to live with nature peacefully.
                            They continuously developing economic status of India through their start-ups. There are
                            many live examples like paytm, snapdeal, Hike, Housing, Yepme, Justdial, ShopClues and
                            Redbus etc.</p>
                        <p>According to a survey of Times of India, India is one of the largest producers of engineers
                            in the world. Many of engineers serve for India and some of them settled in reputed company
                            in foreign. When an engineer from India invent or design something new and innovative whole
                            nation feel proud. There are 12% scientists in NASA from India and 38% employ of Microsoft
                            are Indians. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was an Ideal personally, He was an aerospace engineers. He
                            was first president who is an engineer in India 2002-07. He was also work for Defence
                            Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
                            and military missile development efforts. From all this we can easily understand how an
                            engineer develop India. There are many engineers like Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam who work for this
                            nation in research and development.</p>
                        <p>In the History, Engineers also plays epic role. At the time of Mughal Empire they build
                            buildings like Qutub Minar, Taj Mahal, Charminar and other monuments having a great
                            architecture. During 1900-47 engineers are working for development of British India in key
                            sectors: public works, railways and private industries.</p>
                        <p>There are long list of uncountable achievements that engineers made and lots of things that
                            they doing continuously. But they don’t think about nature and environment. Sometime
                            corruption done by engineers cause development like on 31 march 2016, part of the
                            under-construction Vivekananda flyover in Kolkata collapsed and 27 people were dead and 80
                            were injured in the incident. Due to irresponsibility of engineers Bhopal Gas Disaster on
                            2-3 December 1984 happened. Engineers have to understand the merits and demerits of things
                            that they are going design and build before development. “Education is the most powerful
                            weapon which you can use to change the world, Nelson Mandela”. Which type of change we want
                            in this world? All of us want is brighter and well developed nation, for this we have to
                            serve our nation without any greediness and truthfully.</p>
